# Simple Example of Node.js App on Server

This is a simple Node.js starter app I often use to start a node.js app with a server on port 3000. This App uses the power of Express Framework to render plain HTML files in your App and also Static pages using EJS.

## Installation

Use the NPM package manager to install this app.
```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/edwinaquino/nodejs-starter-app.git
cd nodejs-starter-app
npm build
```

## Start the server

```bash
npm start
```

## Open In Browser
Your app should now be running on port 3000. One your browser to: http://localhost:3000

Enjoy
